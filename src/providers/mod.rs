//! Provider trait and concrete provider implementations.
//!
//! Each supported provider (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Cline,
//! Aider, Amp, OpenCode, ChatGPT, ClawdBot, Vibe, Factory, OpenClaw,
//! Pi-Agent) implements the [`Provider`] trait to read/write sessions in its
//! native format.
